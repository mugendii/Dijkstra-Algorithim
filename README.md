# Dijkstra-Algorithm
Dijkstra algorithm is a solution to the shortest single source path in graph theory.
It works on both directed and undirected graphs, however all nodes shoud have non-negative weights
It is profoundly used in computer networks to generate optimal routes with the aim of minimizing routing costs.
It is a greedy algorithm because you always mark the closest vertex.
It's dynamic because distances are updated using previously calculated values. So then it is a good place to learn both concepts in one algorithm
